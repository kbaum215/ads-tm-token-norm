Meaning, if an error is produced, that means there is a flaw in the logic and there is less to disentangle later had the assertion statement not been used. In this way, assertion statements validate the code is working as expected and can cut down the time it takes to handle errors and bugs. "

Having said that, in both Kanye and Joni we see some similarities. \n",

I believe both are very poetic in how they write their songs. What is interesting is that Kanye's 25 songs contain much more content per song than Joni's 25 songs. Joni's songs contain 2649 words, while Kanye's songs contain 8496 words. That's more than 3 times as many words! However, he obviously repeats a lot of words given the relative lack of lexical diversity. "

The `+` is a quantifier in regular expressions. It matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element.
